  title    = "Fully implicit simulation of polymer flooding with {MRST}",
  author   = "Bao, Kai and Lie, Knut-Andreas and M{\o}yner, Olav and Liu, Ming",
  abstract = "The present work describes a fully implicit simulator for polymer
              injection implemented in the free, open-source MATLAB Reservoir
              Simulation Toolbox (MRST). Polymer injection is one of the widely
              used enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, and complicated
              physical process is involved, which makes accurate simulation
              very challenging. The proposed work is intended for providing a
              powerful and flexible tool to investigate the polymer injection
              process in realistic reservoir scenarios. Within the model, the
              polymer component is assumed to be only transported in the water
              phase and adsorbed in the rock. The hydrocarbon phases are not
              influenced by the polymer, and they are described with the
              standard, three-phase, black-oil equations. The effects of the
              polymer are simulated based on the Todd--Longstaff mixing model,
              accounting for adsorption, inaccessible pore space, and
              permeability reduction effects. Shear-thinning/thickening effects
              based on shear rate are also included by the means of a separate
              inner-Newton iteration process within the global nonlinear
              iteration. The implementation is based on the automatic
              differentiation framework in MRST (MRST-AD), and an iterative
              linear solver with a constrained pressure residual (CPR)
              preconditioner is used to solve the resulting linear systems
              efficiently. We discuss certain implementation details to show
              how convenient it is to use the existing functionality in MRST to
              develop an accurate and efficient polymer flooding simulator for
              real fields. With its modular design, vectorized implementation,
              support for stratigraphic and general unstructured grids, and
              automatic differentiation framework, MRST is a very powerful
              prototyping and experimentation platform for development of new
              reservoir simulators. To verify the simulator, we first compare
              it with a commercial simulator and good agreement is achieved.
              Then, we apply the new simulator to a few realistic reservoir
              models to investigate the effect of adding polymer injection, and
              computational efficiency is demonstrated. Finally, we combine
              existing optimization functionality in MRST with the new polymer
              simulator to optimize polymer flooding for two different
              reservoir models. We argue that the presented software framework
              can be used as an efficient prototyping tool to evaluate new
              models for polymer--water flooding processes in real reservoir
              fields.",

  abstract = "Ensemble-based optimization has recently received great attention
              as a potentially powerful technique for life-cycle production
              optimization, which is a crucial element of reservoir management.
              Recent publications have increased both the number of
              applications and the theoretical understanding of the algorithm.
              However, there is still ample room for further development since
              most of the theory is based on strong assumptions. Here, the
              mathematics (or statistics) of Ensemble Optimization is studied,
              and it is shown that the algorithm is a special case of an
              already well-defined natural evolution strategy known as Gaussian
              Mutation. A natural description of uncertainty in reservoir
              management arises from the use of an ensemble of history-matched
              geological realizations. A logical step is therefore to
              incorporate this uncertainty description in robust life-cycle
              production optimization through the expected objective function
              value. The expected value is approximated with the mean over all
              geological realizations. It is shown that the frequently
              advocated strategy of applying a different control sample to each
              reservoir realization delivers an unbiased estimate of the
              gradient of the expected objective function. However, this
              procedure is more variance prone than the deterministic strategy
              of applying the entire ensemble of perturbed control samples to
              each reservoir model realization. In order to reduce the variance
              of the gradient estimate, an importance sampling algorithm is
              proposed and tested on a toy problem with increasing
              dimensionality.",

abstract = {In science and engineering, non-linear constrained optimization has been a useful mathematical technique for many practical applications. Of interest to us is its applicability in the modeling and prediction of hydrocarbon reservoir production. In this paper, a new efficient, robust, and accurate optimal solution strategy based on the exterior penalty function (EPF) method and the adaptive ensemble-based optimization (EnOpt) approach (with backtracking line-search technique) for non-linear constrained optimization problems is presented. The purpose of this work is to provide a better user-friendly strategy which mitigates the problem often faced with the current constraints handling technique utilized when using the EnOpt method to solve constrained problems of water or EOR flooding. This study notes that the problem contributes to uncertainties in the gradient computation of the objective function and hence leads to the poor convergence rate of the standard EnOpt method. In this work, we used the EPF method to transform a given constrained optimization problem to a sequence of unconstrained subproblems and then sequentially solve the subproblems by unconstrained EnOpt procedure until convergence to the solution of the original problem. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methodology, we used it to solve analytical 2D bound constrained Rosenbrock’s problem and a practical high dimensional bound constrained water flooding optimization problem associated with a 2D 5Spot field and a 3D Reek reservoir field. The numerical results are compared with EnOpt using classical Lagrangian approach, as well as the traditional EnOpt. Our findings showed that the proposed solution method has a fast convergence rate and is more accurate and robust.}

The space discretization of the state variable is done using usual conforming finite elements, whereas the time discretization is based on discontinuous Galerkin methods. For different types of control discretizations we provide error estimates of optimal order with respect to both space and time discretization parameters. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part we develop some stability and error estimates for space-time discretization of the state equation and provide error estimates for optimal control problems without control constraints. In the second part of the paper, the techniques and results of the first part are used to develop a priori error analysis for optimal control problems with pointwise inequality constraints on the control variable. }

  abstract  = "AbstractA key challenge in reservoir management and other fields
               of engineering involves optimizing a nonlinear function
               iteratively. Due to the lack of available gradients in
               commercial reservoir simulators the attention over the last
               decades has been on gradient free methods or gradient
               approximations. In particular, the ensemble-based optimization
               has gained popularity over the last decade due to its simplicity
               and efficient implementation when considering an ensemble of
               reservoir models. Typically, a regression type gradient
               approximation is used in a backtracking or line search setting.
               This paper introduces an approximation of the Hessian utilizing
               a Monte Carlo approximation of the natural gradient with respect
               to the covariance matrix. This Hessian approximation can further
               be implemented in a trust region approach in order to improve
               the efficiency of the algorithm. The advantages of using such
               approximations are demonstrated by testing the proposed
               algorithm on the Rosenbrock function and on a synthetic

abstract="Validation can be used to detect when overfitting starts during supervised training of a neural network; training is then stopped before convergence to avoid the overfitting (``early stopping''). The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoff between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using different 12 problems and 24 different network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4{\%} on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).",
